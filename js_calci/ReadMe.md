    The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:
     xs (phones), sm (tablets), md (desktops), and lg (larger desktops). The classes can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts. Tip: Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs.
